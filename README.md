Those data structures are built on top of finite state transducers, which allows
them to be extremely compact while offering fast lookup.

This is especially for read-only indexes (both in-memory or on-disk).

## Installation

### Cargo

* Install the rust toolchain in order to have cargo installed by following
  [this](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) guide.
* run `cargo install h3o-ice`

## Usage

```rust
use h3o::{LatLng, Resolution};
use h3o_ice::FrozenSet;

let coord = LatLng::new(48.872280706 2.332697839).expect("valid coord");
let set = FrozenSet::try_from_iter(
    coord.to_cell(Resolution::Nine)
        .children(Resolution::Ten)
)
.expect("failed to create set");

set.contains(CellIndex::try_from(0x8a1fb4666417fff).expect("valid cell"));
```
